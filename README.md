# TimeSavor!

## User Story
```
AS A person who works/learns from home
I WANT to be able to find a time-saving recipe that works for my lunch break 
SO THAT I have enough time to cook and eat
```
## Acceptance Criteria
This website follows the criteria of:
```
GIVEN a homepage with a form input
WHEN I add my specifications for meal, cuisine, restrictions, and time
THEN I am brought to a new page displaying any recipes with my specific requests in the form of cards as well as another form input incase I change any specifications
WHEN I click on one of the recipe cards to view the recipe page
THEN I am brought to a new page with details on the recipe, a youtube tutorial link, recipe link, and a back button
WHEN I click the theme switch button on any page
THEN I am presented with an inverted version of the site based on its theme switch
```

## Description
For this project, we utilized two API's, one for recipes and one for youtube, to create TimeSavor! an effective and useful site to find time efficient, savory
recipes based on your own specifications. The user can enter their specifications on certain foods, restrictions, and time limits, then they are brought to a new page with
recipes based on their specifications for them to select, and once selected the user is brought to a details page for their selected recipe where they can see a youtube tutorial
as well as the ingridients and a link to the full recipe.
